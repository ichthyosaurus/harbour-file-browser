 * Added a call-for-support popup that shows up automatically when the app is used frequently
 * Added a new page showing currently copied/cut files (swipe right-to-left to the shortcuts page, then select "Clipboard")
 * Added quick access to overviews of all documents and multimedia files on the shortcuts page (this uses system components that sadly have terrible performance)
 * Added section headers when sorting by file type, which makes it easier to find files of a specific type
 * Added support for creating folders with subfolders and for creating empty files

Published in OpenRepos and Jolla store on 2021-01-12 by ichthyosaurus.

 * Finally out of beta
 *   - Configuration is now stored at ~/.config/harbour-file-browser. Copy your beta configuration from ~/.config/harbour-file-browser-beta to keep custom shortcuts.
 *   - You can safely remove the folder ~/.local/share/harbour-file-browser-beta.

 *   - Note: it might be necessary to manually remove the old packages harbour-file-browser-beta and harbour-file-browser-root-beta
 * Updated translations: Swedish, Chinese, German
 * Greatly improved performance when loading folders and moving/deleting files
 *   - before: loading a folder with 5000 images (sorted by modification time) took ~5 seconds, moving/deleting 1 file took ~8 seconds; with times climbing exponentially
 *   - now: loading the same folder (any sorting mode) is nearly instantly, moving/deleting too
 *   - now: sorting mode will no longer noticeably affect performance (sorting by modification time was by far the slowest mode before)
 *   - note: when deleting/moving/filtering more than 200 files the view will lose its position and jump to the top
 * Greatly improved filtering performance
 *   - before: filtering a folder with 5000 images took ~20 seconds, scrolling was nearly impossible
 *   - now: the same folder filters nearly instantly, scrolling is smooth

 *   - use '[abc]' to match one character of the group in square brackets
 *   - to include a literal '*' or '?' you have to enclose it in square brackets
 * Added proper user feedback while loading folders
 * Added indicators for files that are being moved/deleted
