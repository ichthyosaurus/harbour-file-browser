ifdef(${__X_harbour}, ${
## Limitations in this version
}, ${
## Limitations in Jolla's Harbour store
})

__name in Jolla's Harbour store cannot show all files due to mandatory
sandboxing (Sailjail) since Sailfish OS 4.4. Inaccessible folders appear empty
as there is no way for the app to determine if a folder is actually empty or
simply presented as empty by the system.

Additionally, some file previews and integrated access to storage settings are
disabled.

ifdef(${__X_harbour}, ${
If you need full access to all files, please install __name from
[OpenRepos](https://openrepos.net/content/ichthyosaurus/file-browser).
}, ${
The version on [OpenRepos](https://openrepos.net/content/ichthyosaurus/file-browser)
is not affected by these limitations.
})

## Permissions

__name requires the following permissions:

- Audio: for playing previews of audio files
- MediaIndexing: to list all documents
- RemovableMedia: for browsing USB sticks and SD cards
- UserDirs and PublicDir: to show as many files as possible while restricted by Sailjail

**Note:** sandboxing is only enabled for builds in Jolla's Harbour store. The
version on [OpenRepos](https://openrepos.net/content/ichthyosaurus/file-browser)
has no such restrictions and can show all files.
})

## Root mode

__name can run with administrator privileges to give you unrestricted access to
your system. To use this feature, you must install
[Root mode for __name](https://openrepos.net/content/ichthyosaurus/root-mode-file-browser-v2)
from OpenRepos. Root mode is protected by your lock code.
